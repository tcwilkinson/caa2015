Introduction
What is FS: "Free Software is a set of practices for the distributed collabora-
tive creation of software source code that is then made openly and
freely available through a clever, unconventional use of copyright law" 

"Since about 1998, the practices and ideas of Free Software have extended into new realms of life
and creativity: from software to music and film to science, engineer-
ing, and education; from national politics of intellectual property
to global debates about civil society; from UNIX to Mac OS X and
Windows; from medical records and databases to international dis-
ease monitoring and synthetic biology; from Open Source to open
access. Free Software is no longer only about software—it exempli-
fies a more general reorientation of power and knowledge."

"I introduce the concept of a “recursive public.” A recursive public is a public that is
vitally concerned with the material and practical maintenance and modi-
fication of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual means of its
own existence as a public; it is a collective independent of other forms of
constituted power and is capable of speaking to existing forms of power
through the production of actually existing alternatives."

Chapter 1 "Geeks and Recursive Publics"
Author definde recursive (activities of making, maintaining, and modifying software and network ; depth of it) and geek.
The settle to explain the contour of the culture of FS "If intuition can lead one from geek to geek, from start-up to night-
club, and across countries, languages, and professional orienta-
tions, it can only be due to a shared set of ideas of how things fit
together in the world. These ideas might be “cultural”"
Refers to Taylor and speak of the "social imaginary [...] The concept of a social imaginary also avoids the conundrums
created by the concept of “ideology” and its distinction from mate-
rial practice. " with discussion around Ducoeur, Taylor, Geertz.
